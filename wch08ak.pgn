{It wasn't a riveting start but you don't get many risks taken in game one
when the score is still level. Kramnik asked a question, Anand answered
confidently} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 {The Exchange Slav, the sure
way to play with zero losing chances so an ideal choice for game one} cxd5 5.
Bf4 Nc6 6. e3 Bf5 7. Nf3 e6 {Black cannot continue symmetrically for too long
of course but this is the most solid choice} 8. Qb3 Bb4 9. Bb5 O-O {
Black breaks the symmetry but this is still the main line of chess opening
theory} 10. Bxc6 (10. O-O Bxc3 11. Bxc6 Bxb2 12. Bxb7 Bxa1 13. Rxa1 Rc8 14.

by playing Bf4-b8 x a7 and he won. This shows the pleasant edge White can
achieve sometimes in this line and Black has to struggle to equalise
completely}) 10... Bxc3+ 11. Qxc3 Rc8 {Here and on the next move Anand avoids
bxc6 when the pawn would be very weak. White can easily exert control over c5
and then lay siege to the pawn} (11... bxc6 12. Qxc6 Qa5+ 13. Qc3 Qxc3+ 14.

the cost of a pawn. If there is one man who can make your life miserable if
you have a bad pawn structure it is Kramnik} 15. Qxb7 Qc8 16. Qxc8 (16. Qb3 Qa6

real counterplay} dxe4 22. fxe4 Rd8 23. Rad1 Rc2 {White cannot stay a pawn
ahead and d4-d5 is well met by e6-e5. The next few move just force
simplification and a draw, a minor victory for Anand, he made light of the
attempted squeeze} 24. e5 (24. a4 {or Rc3} e5 25. dxe5 Rxd1 26. Rxd1 fxe5 27.

1. d4 {A surprise but not a total surprise. Vishy has played 1.d4 with success
occasionally and of course he has a specific idea.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {
The solid Nimzo-Indian. Kramnik avoids the sharp lines of Slav Defence in
which he recently lost to AlexanderMorozevich} 4. f3 {This super sharp line
appeared in the 1930s. In the Nimzo the battle for the e4 square is
fundamental in many lines. 4.f3 has been championed recently by the Russian
GMs Viktor Moskalenko and Yuri Yakovich. Now there is crazy stuff after this
sequence - 4...c5 5.d5 Nh5 idea Qh4+ 6.Nh3 and if Qh4+ 7.Nf2 Qxc4 8.e4. The
line was made famous after Florin Gheorghiu played a beautiful game against
Bobby Fischer at Havana 1966.} d5 {Of course Kramnik plays the solid answer} 5.
a3 {Reaching the Saemisch Variation} Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. dxc5 {
This is a highly analysed main line. White intends e2-e4 and in some lines he
hangs to the c5 pawn for a while to obstruct Black's possible play on the cfile
} f5 9. Qc2 Nd7 {
A cunning choice to avoid a prepared idea. Kramnik avoids the main lines with}
(9... O-O 10. e4) (9... f4 10. e4 fxe3 11. Bd3) 10. e4 fxe4 11. fxe4 N5f6 12.
c6 {As in game one Anand avoids pawn weaknesses. The c3 pawn might be targeted
if Black could organise Nd7xc5 and Qd8-c7} bxc6 13. Nf3 Qa5 14. Bd2 {14.Be2 was
possible. Had Vishy managed to place his bishops on c4 and e3 he may have had
an edge. Now it seems roughly level} (14. Be2 Nxe4 $2 15. Qxe4 Qxc3+ 16. Kf2
Qxa1 17. Qxe6+ Kf8 18. Bf4 Qxh1 19. Bd6 {Would be calamitous}) 14... Ba6 {
Kramnik wants to exchange one bishop because White's bishop pair can be strong}
15. c4 Qc5 16. Bd3 Ng4 {
Definitely the most aggressive move of the match so far !} 17. Bb4 Qe3+ 18. Qe2
O-O-O 19. Qxe3 Nxe3 20. Kf2 Ng4+ 21. Kg3 Ndf6 {Opening up the rook on d8 to
attack the bishop on d3. An active choice but is also risky and entails a pawn
sacrifice} 22. Bb1 h5 23. h3 h4+ 24. Nxh4 Ne5 25. Nf3 Nh5+ 26. Kf2 Nxf3 27.
Kxf3 e5 $1 {Kramnik has compensation for the sacrificed pawn based on the poor
bishop on b1, open files for his rooks and the agility of his knight in a
closed position} 28. Rc1 Nf4 29. Ra2 {Rd2 was a threat} Nd3 30. Rc3 Nf4 {
Offering a repetition} 31. Bc2 Ne6 {Kramnik's knight is a great piece. He
might play c6-c5 when Rf8+ is possible. Also there is the idea of Nd4+ and
takes on c2 when we get opposite coloured bishops which increase Black's
chances of a draw} 32. Kg3 Rd4 {Black intends to take on c4 and if 33.c5 then
both white bishops are hemmed in by pawns and Black has decent compensation. A
well played game by Kramnik who probably avoided some sharp preparation. Anand
did not look totally at home in the positions that arose and perhaps he might
have played on with 33.Rb2. Although he is losing the c4 pawn this inevitably
releases his light squared bishop. Notes by Malcolm Pein who runs

1. d4 Nf6 {Forgive me but today I was watching this game on 3G from Anfield,
the home of Liverpool Football Club and seeing Liverpool come back from 1-2
down to beat Wigan 3-2 was distracting and joyful in equal measure. If Kramnik
was planning to come back from 1-2 down tday then 7.a3 sent a message that a
wild fight was not on the agenda. I found it hard to know what to take from
this game. Was Anand just being too cautious? or did Kramnik just demonstrate
how to hold a slightly inferior position without breaking sweat?} 2. c4 e6 3.
Nf3 {3.Nc3 Bb4 was Game 2 but Vishy also shows he is happy to play against the
Queen's Indian 3...b6} d5 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 {Anand prefers Bf4 to the more
common Bg5 - this can lead to sharp positions where White castles queenside}
O-O 6. e3 Nbd7 (6... c5 7. dxc5 Nc6 8. Qc2 Bxc5 9. a3 Qa5 10. O-O-O {

can force Black to accept an isolated queen's pawn} 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Nxd5 exd5
10. dxc5 Nxc5 {Anand's wants a position where he can play with a tiny edge and
try to exert psychological pressure. Kramnik avoids this skilfully} 11. Be5 {
White emphasises his control of the square in front of the isolated pawn. This
is essential, the pawn must be blocked before it can beattacked} Bf5 (11... Bf6
{is standard but again, Kramnik may be motivated by a desire to avoid any
preparation} 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Qd4 Qxd4 14. Nxd4 Bd7 {and Black continued with
Ne6 and equalised quickly in Kasparov v Kramnik Blitz 2001 draw in 24.}) 12.

he menaces Nb3}) 14... Ne6 {Black fights for the d4 square} 15. Nxf5 (15. Nxe6

he is usually fine. This is not a rash attacking move, it's positionally

problems as we will see.} 23. Bh3 Rad8 24. g3 g5 $1 {
Kramnik plays to evict the bishop as mentioned above.} (24... Ne6 25. Bxe6

{2.5-5.5 down Vlad had to play for a win with black, or win 'away from home'.
The last time he managed that was 2006 when Veselin Topalov missed a mate
before losing. However, I was following the chess from Stamford Bridge the
home of Chelski Football Club (the home of no European Cups) and by the time
Anand had played 1.d4 Alonso had already put the mighty Liverpool FC 0-1 ahead
and Chelsea, who had not lost at home for 4.5 years were on their way to
defeat (hurrah). So one record was about to be broken perhaps another would go.

Black does not usually do this. It might win a pawn but it ruins the pawn

well} (12... Bd7 13. g3 O-O-O 14. Kb1 {
